How should one read Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) to get the most out of it?

"I think there are three levels in reading this book.
1. [Easy] Read the algorithm, understand how it works and try out examples. Implement it.
 Example:
 Read quicksort, easy to understand. Implement it. (or)
 Read Prim's algo - Understand how it works.

2. [Medium] Understand the analysis parts of it.
 Example:
 Read and understand the average case complexity analysis of quicksort. (or)
 Prim's algo - Proof of correctness.

3. [Advanced] Try solving the problems at the end of each chapter and further reading.
 Example:
 Analysis of quick sort if all elements are not distinct. (or)
 Second best MST.

You can read the book at any level. To begin with, try to see how the algorithm works. If it doesn't make complete sense, try reading again.  Each algorithm almost always comes with an example. See if you could solve that example. Solving the example shows that you have understood the basics.

Next, dive a little deeper and understand the mathematical parts. In specific, the complexity analysis. This will require you to brush up the basic math.

Now, if you have understood the basic algos and also their mathematical counterparts, try to solve the exercises at the end of the chapter. Solving the exercises will really make you a specialist in that area. Problems are generally of medium+ difficulty. Some problems will require a lot of research that will broaden your knowledge in the area and will also set the right track for further research.

Most important, have fun and good luck!"
